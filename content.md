### 3. About me

- **6+ years experience** as a front-end developer
- I have extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS (Sass) & JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript and experience with the most popular framework (React). Add ambition, endless curiosity and a GTD-mindset and you have a pretty complete picture of me.
- **From big to small companies, two things I always promise:**
  1. Code you will love
  - This is what I love to do, so I'll make sure you are happy with the results. We'll work as a team and we'll get there!
  2. A healthy relationship
  - No dramas or difficult relationships. I'm here to make your life easier, solve problems and help you grow your business.
- "I was told that Doğucan can do miracles. I was skeptical at first but when I saw the results he delivered, I became a true believer! We had a very complex project delivered to us in a record time. An extremely capable & helpful developer."
